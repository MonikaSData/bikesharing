Analyze Citibike data in NYC using Tableau. 

## Overview of Project
**Purpose:**
The purpose of this project is to conduct a bike trip analysis of NYC data to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business.

**Task:** 
To complete this project, we will use Pandas  to format our data and use Tableau to visualize and tell our story.

**Approach:**
Using Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype.
Using the Tableau to create set of visualizations to communicate our findings.

**Method:** Using Python (Pandas) and Tableau.
